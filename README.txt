Readme file for Project 1 of the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree, Version 1.0 March 26 2014.  This program is written using Python.

This project creates a website to store my favorite movies, including movie title, box art URL (or poster URL), a YouTube link to the movie trailer, who stars in the movie, and the movie rating.

What's included:
There are 3 programs associated with this project.  These programs have been compressed into one file.

The 3 programs are:

1) media3 - this program creates a data structure (i.e. a Python Class) for the movie attributes.  This movie attributes are:
	*movie title, 
	*box art URL (or poster URL), 
	*a YouTube link to the movie trailer, 
	*who stars in the movie, and 
	*the movie rating.

2) entertainment_center3 - creates multiple instances of the Python Class to represent my favorite movies; 
3) fresh_tomatoes2 - a Python module called fresh_tomatoes.py was generously provided by Udacity.  This module generates the website that displays these movies. 	Along with a this module is a function called open_movies_page that takes in one argument, which is a list of movies and creates an HTML file which 		visualizes all of my favorite movies. 
	This module was modified slightly to customize the website with additional movie information such as who stars in the movie and the movie ratings. Then 	renamed fresh_tomatoes2.


To run these programs Python needs to be installed on your computer, if it is not already.

First of all check that you don't already have Python installed by entering python in a command line window. If you see a response from a Python interpreter it will include a version number in its initial display. Generally any recent version will do, as Python makes every attempt to maintain backwards compatibility.

If you need to install Python, you may as well download the most recent stable version. This is the one with the highest number that isn't marked as an alpha or beta release. For example sake the instructions below use Python version 2.7.6, but this version may have been superseded by a later version.

Here are the steps for downloading Python on Windows:

1) Navigate to http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.6/
2) Click on the link “Windows x86 MSI Installer”.
3) This will download “python-2.7.6.msi” on your computer. Once the download is finished, run this file.  If you see a warning like the one to the right, click “Run”. (Don’t worry about the warning. It usually appears when installing Python.)
4) Follow the installation wizard. Let Python install to its default directory, C:\Python27\
5) To confirm that your installation was successful, open IDLE. (IDLE is a program that makes it easy to edit and run Python code.) To open IDLE you can select Start > All
Programs > Python 2.7 > IDLE (Python GUI).  If you are on Windows 8, search for IDLE in the app list.
6) Once IDLE is open, you should see a window open that show Python 2.7.6 Shell
7) In the new window, try a few test commands, like 2+2 or print(“hello, world”).
8) you're done.

Here are the steps for downloading Python on Macs:

1) Begin by determining what version of Mac OS X you have. Click the Apple Logo in the top left hand corner of your screen and select “About this Mac”.
2) The version number is displayed under the Apple OS X logo.
3) Navigate to http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.6/
4) If your Mac OS version from step 2 was 10.6 or higher, select the link "Mac OS X 64-bit/32-bitx86-64/i386 installer (2.7.6) for Mac OS X 10.6 and later". Otherwise,
select the link "Mac OS X 32-bit i386/PPC Installer(2.7.6) for Mac OS X 10.3 and later"
5) Open the file you downloaded, and click on the ‘python.mpkg’ file while holding down the ‘control’ key.
6) Select “Open” from the drop-down list.
7) Select “Open” on the warning box that appears. (Don’t worry about the warning. It usually appears when installing Python.)
8) Follow the steps in the Python Installer to successfully install Python.
9) To confirm that your installation was successful, open IDLE. (IDLE is a program that makes it easy to edit and run Python code.) To find idle, you can use ?+Space to open spotlight and type ‘idle’.
10) Once IDLE is open, you should see a window titled "Python 2.7.6 Shell". Please press enter and ignore the warning.
11) Try a few test commands like 2+2 or print(“hello, world”).
12) you're done.

After successfully installation of Python you can now run the programs for Project 1.  

Run the program locally:

1) Unzip the compressed file 
2) Store the 3 programs and the README file separately in the same folder under the Python27 folder created on your hard drive
3) Open IDLE.  (IDLE is a program that makes it easy to edit and run Python code.) 
	To open IDLE in Window you can select Start > All Programs > Python 2.7 > IDLE (Python GUI).  If you are on Windows 8, search for IDLE in the app list.
	To open IDLE in MAC, use ?+Space to open spotlight and type ‘idle’.
4) Once IDLE is open, go to "File" on the window toolbar and click 'Open'
5) Open the "entertainment_center3" file from the folder where you saved in from step 2 above.
6) Once file is open, click on "Run" in the window toolbar, then highlight "Run Module" and click on it
7) The website with the movies will be displayed.
8) Click on any of the movie posters to watch the trailer for that movie
9) Enjoy!
